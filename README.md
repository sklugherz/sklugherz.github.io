# My Portfolio Website

Made with HTML, CSS, JS, and Vue.js.

## Plans

1. elimiate code smells via inhertiance and slots from duplicate layouts
    1. start with uses to get a basic list layout
2. create the initial project layout page from concept art
    1. create aside of projects, add js to remove right border and show arrow
        - play around with color of unselected projects
    2. create main inset/offset container with short hero desc., keywords, and img
        - change background to lighter or darker depending on offset/inset and add shadow/lighting shadow
3. add filter for project based on keywords: Games, CyberSec, Langauge specific, etc
